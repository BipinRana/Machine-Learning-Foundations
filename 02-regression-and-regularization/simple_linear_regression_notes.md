Day2: Linear Regression
When we think of machine learning, Artifical Intelligence, we directly think of robots, chatGPT and such.
But the basics start with understanding techniques like regression, greedy algorithms that iteratively finds solutions.

At first we learn about Linear Regression (using single feature). It is a type of algorithm that creates a line that best represents a set of data. However, this regression model cannot always represent a polynomial/exponential/trigonometric relation. So, we make few assumptions:
1) There is only one feature or independent variable(x) that the product/vector or dependent variable(y) is dependent on.
    But what are these terms that i just used? feature? vector? Feature is a set of independent values, they do not depend on any other values. For instance, the number of rooms in a house is an independent value. however, for same feature, we have an important value that depends on it. here, for each room increase, the rent price can increase linearly.

2) There should be linear relation between the feature(x) and the vector(y). If the relation is not linear, there are conditions of overfitting/underfitting.

3) The features (x0,x1,x2,x3..xn) should not be dependent on each other. For example, x0=0,x1=1,x2=1,x3=2,x4=3.. These values of x actually represent a fibbonacci sequence.x3 depends on x0,x1 hence creating a collinearity.

4) The marginal error on the line/model we get, should be small and normally distributed. This normal distributed ensures that the systematic trend in data are captured and the remaining noises(errors) are random.

5) We should also take steps on detecting and removing outliers. Outliers are those exceptional value that drastically deviate the mean,median,mode and this causes unwanted redundancies
